# Barcode-tracer

This repository contains the code and software required to construct a barcode tracking app that can be used to scan or manually enter barcodes.

The program does a database search and checks for duplicates after the user has scanned or inputted the barcode and pushed enter. The user will get a pop-up error notice if a duplicate is discovered.

The BartenderTracer app was created using resources, including any kind of open source media and code, which are the intellectual property of Nortier Geyer and Rynhardt Geyer.
